- **Industry Multiplier**: [Industry] = [0.8-1.3x]

**Your Target Range**:
- **Minimum Acceptable**: CHF [floor]k (walk-away point)
- **Target Range**: CHF [target_min]-[target_max]k
- **Ideal Outcome**: CHF [ideal]k

### Justification Points

Option B (Direct):
"I'm currently at CHF [current+10%]k and looking for a role in the CHF [target_min]-[target_max]k range, which aligns with market rates for [role/experience level] in [city]. What's the budget for this position?"

### Walk-Away Point

**Minimum Acceptable**: CHF [floor]k

**Why**: Below this amount represents:
- Less than [X]% increase from current role

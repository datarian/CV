## Design Considerations

### 1. Color Accessibility
**Finding:** Light blue (#39a7d0) has 3.4:1 contrast ratio on white background.

**Analysis:** While below WCAG AA standard for body text (4.5:1), this is acceptable because:
- Used only for headers and large text
- Not used for critical content requiring high contrast
- Provides brand identity without compromising readability
- All body text uses black (21:1 contrast)

**Recommendation:** Continue current usage. Do not use light blue for body text or small text.

### 2. Photo Size
**Finding:** Photo is 64x64pt (approximately 23mm square).

**Analysis:** 
- Appropriate size for Swiss CV standards
- Visible but not dominating
- Square format professional
- Proportional to header elements

**Recommendation:** Maintain current size. Acceptable range: 56-72pt.

### 3. Page Length
**Finding:** 2 pages for comprehensive technical CV.

**Analysis:**
- Appropriate for senior technical roles
- Swiss market accepts 2-3 pages
- Better than cramming onto 1 page
- Allows proper detail for achievements

**Recommendation:** 2-3 pages acceptable. Prioritize readability over brevity.

%
% WORKFLOW FOR CREATING JOB-SPECIFIC RESUME:
%
% 1. COPY TEMPLATE
%    cp resumes/templates/CV_template.tex resumes/customized/YYYY_MM_DD_company_role.tex
%
% 2. ANALYZE JOB POSTING
%    - Identify required vs nice-to-have skills
%    - Note specific technologies mentioned
%    - Understand role emphasis (IC vs leadership, infrastructure vs ML development)
%
% 3. CUSTOMIZE SECTIONS (in order of importance)
%    a) Title: Tailor job title to match target role terminology
%    b) Professional Summary: 2-3 sentences emphasizing most relevant aspects
%    c) Core Competencies: Choose 3-4 areas that match job requirements
%    d) Experience: Rewrite bullet points to emphasize relevant aspects
%    e) Projects: Select 2-4 projects that best demonstrate required skills
%    f) Technologies: Prioritize and organize based on job description
%
% 4. KEYWORD OPTIMIZATION
%    - Include exact technology names from job posting
%    - Use similar terminology (e.g., "MLOps" vs "ML Infrastructure")
%    - Add industry-specific terms
%
% 5. COMPILE AND REVIEW
%    cd resumes/customized/
%    xelatex YYYY_MM_DD_company_role.tex
%    # Review PDF for ATS compatibility and visual appeal
%
% 6. CLEAN UP
%    rm -f *.aux *.log *.out *.fls *.fdb_latexmk *.gz
